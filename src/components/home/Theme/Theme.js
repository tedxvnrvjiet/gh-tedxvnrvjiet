            In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed the Chaos Theory, which suggests that small, seemingly insignificant events can have profound effects on complex systems. He proposed that a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world could potentially cause a chain of events that could lead to a tornado in another part of the world.

        <p className='text-black p-4 text-xl'>
            This concept gave birth to the term "Butterfly Effect" which suggests that even the smallest actions can have significant impacts. The idea behind the Butterfly Effect is that every individual has the power to make a positive change in their community, no matter how small the change may be.

            The theme for TEDxVNRVJIET 2023 is "The Butterfly Effect" which aims to explore the opportunities for creating meaningful change in our communities. The goal of the event is to inspire the audience to reflect on the future they are creating and encourage them to take actions that can have a profound global impact.

            Overall, the Butterfly Effect is a powerful philosophy that highlights the importance of taking action, no matter how small, to create a positive impact in the world. TEDxVNRVJIET 2023 aims to showcase this concept and inspire individuals to make a difference in their communities.
